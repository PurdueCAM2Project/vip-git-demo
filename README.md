Tutorial
=========

We will be using this repository to learn a bit about how to use git.
The idea is to learn a bit about git's distributed workflow concept.
This is not aimed at being a complete tutorial on git. 

However, we we learn a few important basics:

- How to use basic git commands
- How to do social coding by using fork and pull requests
- Team communication is key to minimizing conflicts

Steps to be done _after_ the lecture starts:

- Start by _forking_ this repository. You can press the Fork button on the [vip-git-demo](https://github.com/PurdueCAM2Project/vip-git-demo) page.  Or you can just click [here](https://github.com/PurdueCAM2Project/vip-git-demo#fork-destination-box)  to do the fork into your own GitHub account.

- Once you have a fork, you should see vip-git-demo as a project in your own account. You should also see the Fork count increase by one (on the main PurdueCAM2Project/vip-git-demo) page.

- Clone a copy of your own forked project. Do not clone the PurdueCAM2Project/vip-git-demo repository. You will not have access to push any modifications (and will be frustrated).

- Add an upstream link for pulling changes from the main PurdueCAM2Project/vip-get-demo repository.

- Follow Dr. Thiruvathukal's instructions for making some initial changes and commits to the project.

- Commit your changes.

- Return to your page at GitHub and issue a pull request.

- Pull changes from the upstream repository.

- etc.
